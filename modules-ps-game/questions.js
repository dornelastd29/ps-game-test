  info: "Gran Turismo, made by Polyphony Digital, is the best-selling franchise on PlayStation, with more than 90 million copies sold across 8 main games (Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo 2, Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec, Gran Turismo 4, Gran Turismo 5, Gran Turismo 6, Gran Turismo Sport, and Gran Turismo 7), and 8 other titles, including prologues and concepts. Gran Turismo is an icon both inside and outside the gaming world, revered by drivers and automakers from all over the globe. This recognition throughout the automotive world brought the Vision program to the game, which consists of partnerships with automakers such as Lamborghini, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Bugatti, among others. In this partnership, concept cars are created with revised visuals between the manufacturers and Polyphony Digital, and these concept cars are included in the games for free. The franchise is currently on a roll, with the latest game, Gran Turismo 7, being the best-selling game in the franchise.",

  info: "Uncharted 2 by Naughty Dog was named Game of the Year in 2009. The game innovated and marked the industry with its action scenes both in cutscenes and gameplay. God of War by Santa Monica Studio was named Game of the Year in 2018. The game reinvented the franchise completely, bringing combat that is, personally, the best ever done in a game. Its story and characters are remarkable and brought a new perspective to Kratos, one of the greatest characters in the world of games, showing who this character really is in more depth. The Last of Us Part II, also from Naughty Dog, was voted Game of the Year in 2020. The game brought what was expected from Naughty Dog: technically, the game borders on perfection, with unique details and animations, combat beyond any other TPS, and a risky and distressing story like never before.",

Zeus' intention was to prevent the fulfillment of a prophecy that predicted the destruction of Olympus at the hands of a marked warrior. The gods of Olympus believed Deimos was the warrior of the prophecy due to his birthmark (the red stripe). During the kidnapping, Kratos tried to prevent Ares from taking him, but Ares burned him and scarred his eye. Soon after, Kratos made a red tattoo on his body, identical to Deimos' birthmark, in memory of his brother.",

There was a Kratos before and after 'losing' his family. Before that, he was disciplined and would do anything for those he had to protect, which is exactly what he does when he chases redemption. There is no forgiveness for what he did, and as much as he is afraid of losing everything and everyone and becoming what he has become, he is not looking for something new; he is looking to be who he really is.",
